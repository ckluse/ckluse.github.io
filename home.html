                <p>Welcome to my portfolio!</p>
                <p>Hi, I'm [Your Name], a versatile professional with a passion for writing, technology, and lifelong learning. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Geography from [University Name] and a certificate in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) from [Institution Name]. Currently, I am expanding my skill set by pursuing a certificate in Front End Engineering from [Online Program Name].

                    As a freelance writer, I have crafted compelling content across various topics and formats, from blog posts and articles to business plans and technical documentation. I excel at distilling complex ideas into clear, engaging prose that resonates with target audiences. My clients have included [Client 1], [Client 2], [Company A], and [Company B].
                    
                    In my role as an AI trainer, I collaborate with machine learning teams to develop and optimize AI models for various applications. My responsibilities include annotating and labeling data, writing prompts to elicit desired outputs, evaluating model performance, and providing strategic guidance on dataset design. Through this work, I help ensure AI systems are accurate, reliable, and aligned with user needs. Some of my projects have involved training chatbots, refining recommendation engines, and improving natural language processing models.
                    
                    Looking ahead, my career goal is to transition into the tech industry, where I can leverage my unique blend of skills and experiences. I am excited to explore opportunities as a Technical Writer, Prompt Engineer/AI Trainer, or Software Developer. With my strong communication abilities, technical aptitude, and eagerness to learn, I am confident in my ability to make valuable contributions to innovative projects and teams.
