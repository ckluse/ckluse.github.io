            <h1>Professional Summary</h1>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bachelor of Science in Geography</strong> from Valparaiso University (graduated 2015) </li>

                <h2>Content Writing Work</h2>

                <p>For over three years, I've operated a freelance content writing business where I create a variety of content for a diverse list of clients and industries. I've tackled everything from snappy blog posts to dense technical documentation and have worked for several high-profile clients such as Microsoft, Glassdoor, and BetterHelp.

                <h2>Prompt Engineering/AI Training Experience</h2>
            
                As an AI Trainer and Prompt Engineer, I collaborate with AI developers to whip chatbots and and generative AI models into shape. I achieve this by annotating data, writing prompts, and assessing performances of the models. I strategically create prompts to test the models' abilities to follow instructions, provide factual information, and handle unsafe prompts effectively. 

                <h2>Career Goals</h2>
            
                Looking ahead, I'm excited to dive deeper into the tech industry, leveraging my unique blend of communication skills, technical aptitude, and adaptability. I'm open to continuing working as a freelance writer and AI trainer, but am eager to transition into a full-time tech career by 2025. I'm currently open to working as a Technical Writer, Prompt Engineer, or Software Developer. </p></div>
