            <h1>Writing Projects</h1>
            <p>In my three years of freelancing writing, I've had the privilege to work with dozens of clients across several industries. My work involves creating, ghostwriting, or editing a variety of deliverables, including blogs, articles, technical documentation, and e-books. Below are some of the works that I am most proud of.</p>
            
            <h2>Business Plans</h2>
            <p class="toptext">At Growthink, I had the opportunity to work on over 100 business plan templates across two of their websites: <a href="https://www.businessplantemplate.com/">BusinessPlanTemplate.com</a> and <a href="https://planbuildr.com/planning-resources/">PlanBuildr.com</a>. These templates are designed to help aspiring entrepreneurs create their own business plans so they can get funding and launch their businesses.</p>

            <h2>Articles</h2>
            <p class="toptext">
                My most requested service is article writing/ghostwriting for small businesses and solopreneurs. Iâ€™ve created articles on numerous topics, including plants, animals, marketing, and technology. The below articles exemplify my range in writing style and topic.</p>

            <h2>E-books</h2>
            <p class="toptext">Some of my most rewarding writing experiences involve ghostwriting e-books for several clients. These projects take considerable time and require extensive research. Below are two spiritual e-books I ghostwrote for one of my favorite clients. </p>

            <h3><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Chakra-Healing-Shadow-Work-Self-care-ebook/dp/B0BQ1TVTYD/" target="_blank">Chakra Healing with Shadow Work: Self-Care To Integrate Your Shadow, Unblock your Chakras, and Become Whole</a></h3>
            <p>This book introduces readers to the concept of the Shadow and how it can affect their mental health, relationships, and other areas of life. It also serves as an introduction to the seven chakras and explains in depth about how each one affects their shadow sides. Each chapter provides a description of one of the seven chakras, what areas of life it governs, and how healing it can help to heal and integrate the Shadow. The book also provides meditations, yoga poses, and other healing modalities that can balance and align each chakra.</p></div>

            <h3><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tower-Sun-Journey-Trauma-Transformation/dp/B0CKD3L7KH" target="_blank">From the Tower to the Sun: A Tarot Journey from Trauma to Transformation</a></h3>
            <p>This book helps readers who are in the midst of grief or trauma by taking them on a journey through the Major Arcana cards of the tarot. Each chapter gives readers a snapshot of a card in the Major Arcana then shows them how they can apply the card's wisdom to their grief healing process. While most chapters introduce the Major Arcana in their traditional order, this book arranges the cards in order of when their wisdom is most needed when experiencing grief. Therefore, instead of beginning with the Fool (the first card in the Major Arcana deck), the book's first chapter focuses on the Tower since it reprsents the initial shock of loss.</p>
