            <h1>Writing Projects</h1>
            <p>Below are the highlights from my extensive writing career.</p>
            <h2>E-books</h2>
            <p class="toptext">In my career, I've had the privilege of ghostwriting several e-books for various authors and clients. Below are the few that I'm most proud of.</p>
        <div class="flexcontainer">
            <div class="book">
            <img class="book-images" src="Images/chakrabook.png">
            <h3><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Chakra-Healing-Shadow-Work-Self-care-ebook/dp/B0BQ1TVTYD/" target="_blank">Chakra Healing with Shadow Work: Self-Care To Integrate Your Shadow, Unblock your Chakras, and Become Whole</a></h3>
            <p>This book introduces readers to the concept of the Shadow and how it can affect their mental health, relationships, and other areas of life. It also serves as an introduction to the seven chakras and goes into depth about how each one is tied to the concept of the Shadow. Each chapter provides a description of a chakra, what areas of life it governs, and how healing it can help integrate the shadow. The book also provides meditations, yoga poses, and other healing modalities to help balance each chakra.</p></div>
            
            <div class="book">
            <img class="book-images" src="Images/tarotbook.png">
            <h3><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tower-Sun-Journey-Trauma-Transformation/dp/B0CKD3L7KH" target="_blank">From the Tower to the Sun: A Tarot Journey from Trauma to Transformation</a></h3>
            <p>This book guides the reader through trauma, transformation, and loss through the concepts of the major arcana of the tarot. Each chapter details the meanings of one of the major arcana cards and then provides its wisdom for those going through grief. Instead of being in their original arrangement, the chapters/tarot cards are organized by what stages of grief they represent. For example, the first chapter is about the Tower card which represents denial.</p>

            <h2>Business Plans</h2>
            <p class="toptext">At Growthink, I had the opportunity to work on over 100 business plan templates across two of their websites: <a href="https://www.businessplantemplate.com/">BusinessPlanTemplate.com</a> and <a href="https://planbuildr.com/planning-resources/">PlanBuildr.com</a>. These templates are designed to help aspiring entrepreneurs create their own business plans, and I'm proud to have played a role in making the process easier for them. Published templates can be found on corresponding websites.</p>

            <h2>Articles</h2>
            <p class="toptext">
                The primary deliverable I provide as a content writer is articles. I have ghostwritten dozens of articles throughout my career for a diverse clientele. My approach typically involves conducting thorough research on the topic, locating the most reliable and authoritative sources, and crafting content that is both informative and accessible. Below are a few examples of the many articles I've ghostwritten over the years. </p>

            <h2>Other Writing Work</h2>
            <h3>Voice-Over Scripts</h3>
            <p class="toptext">I also had the opportunity to create several voice-over scripts for the app PictureThis. These scripts were designed to educate app users about common plants and provide general care information. I wrote the scripts for videos that featured different plants, highlighting their unique characteristics and care requirements. Below are a few examples of these scripts.</p>

            </ul>
            <h3>Animal Profiles</h3>
            <p class="toptext">I was hired by a nonprofit organization called Save the Dark to write animal profiles that highlighted the importance of reducing light pollution. These profiles featured several nocturnal species that are threatened by the increasing levels of light pollution worldwide. The project required me to conduct extensive research on the animals and their habitats. </p>
